# 9
## a
Nickels are worth 5 cents, and Dimes 10 cents. $a_n$ is the number of possibilities to pay a toll of $n$ cents.

When putting the last coin in, it is either a dime, or a nickel. If it was a dime we put in $n - 10$ cents before, so there are $a_{n - 10}$ ways to do this. If the last coin was a nickel, we put in $n - 5$ cents before, so there are $a_{n - 5}$ ways to do this.

We can derive the following recurrence relation:

* $a_0 = 1$
* $a_5 = 1$
* $a_n = a_{n - 5} + a_{n - 10}$ for $n \geq 10$
